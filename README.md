# find-your-position

This project aims to display the user’s location name based on the latitude and longitude coordinates obtained from the browser’s geolocation feature. This project uses the JavaScript programming language and the jQuery library to manipulate HTML elements and send requests to the nominatim.openstreetmap.org API. This API returns location data in JSON format that is then displayed on the web page. This project also handles various possible errors, such as browsers that do not support geolocation, permission denied, position unavailable, or timeout. This project is a simple example of a web application that utilizes geolocation and map API technologies.
